    ### Instruction:


    Given the following query, generate a double newline separated list of search queries that are relevant to the original query.
    Generate as many queries as you see fit to best answer the user's question, but no more than 5. Each query should be a self-contained question.

    DO NOT generate any single query which is likely to require information from multiple distinct documents,

    EACH single query will be used to carry out a cosine similarity semantic search over distinct indexed documents, such as varied medical documents.

    FOR EXAMPLE if asked `how do the key themes of Great Gatsby compare with 1984`, the two queries would be

    `What are the key themes of Great Gatsby?` and `What are the key themes of 1984?`.
