# Agentic Tool Execution Fixes

## Problem
The StaticResearchAgent was not executing all 4 available tools in agentic mode, leading to incomplete information gathering.

## Available Tools
1. **search_file_knowledge** - Comprehensive document analysis
2. **vector_search** - Semantic similarity search using embeddings
3. **keyword_search** - Exact phrase matching
4. **graph_traversal** - Entity relationship analysis

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Tool Selection (`_determine_optimal_tools`)
- **Before**: Selected 1-3 tools based on query type
- **After**: For complex analysis queries, selects all 4 tools by default
- **Impact**: Ensures comprehensive information gathering for complex queries

### 2. Improved System Prompt
- **Before**: Generic instructions about tool usage
- **After**: Explicit requirements with examples of function_calls format
- **Impact**: LLM better understands how to use tools

### 3. Forced Tool Execution Fallback
- **Before**: If LLM didn't generate tool calls, no tools were executed
- **After**: Multiple fallback mechanisms to ensure tools are executed:
  - Detect missing tool calls on first iteration
  - Force execution of all recommended tools
  - Synthetic tool call generation for tracking
- **Impact**: Guarantees tool execution in pure agentic mode

### 4. Enhanced Debugging and Logging
- Added extensive logging to track tool initialization and execution
- Verification that tools have required methods
- Progress tracking during tool execution
- **Impact**: Better visibility into what's happening during execution

### 5. Robust Error Handling
- Better error handling in tool execution
- Fallback methods for tool calls
- Graceful degradation when tools fail
- **Impact**: More reliable tool execution

## Key Code Changes

### Tool Selection Enhancement
```python
# For complex analysis, always use all tools for comprehensive coverage
if query_type == "complex_analysis":
    fallback_tools = ["search_file_knowledge", "vector_search", "keyword_search", "graph_traversal"]
```

### Forced Tool Execution
```python
# FORCE tool usage in pure agentic mode if no tool calls detected
if not parsed_tool_calls and is_pure_agentic_mode and iterations_count == 1:
    tool_results = await self._force_tool_execution(query, optimal_tool_names)
```

### Enhanced System Prompt
```python
**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR PURE AGENTIC MODE:**
- You MUST use tools to gather ALL information
- Start IMMEDIATELY with function_calls to execute tools
- Your first response MUST contain function_calls
```

## Testing
Created `test_agentic_tool_execution.py` to verify:
- ✅ All 4 tools are properly initialized
- ✅ Complex analysis queries select all 4 tools
- ✅ Tools have required execute methods
- ✅ Query classification works correctly

## Expected Behavior
1. **Query Classification**: Complex queries → "complex_analysis" type
2. **Tool Selection**: Complex analysis → All 4 tools selected
3. **Tool Execution**: All selected tools are executed, either via LLM function calls or forced execution
4. **Result Synthesis**: Tool results are combined into comprehensive final answer

## Verification
Run the test to verify fixes:
```bash
python test_agentic_tool_execution.py
```

Expected output should show all 4 tools initialized and selected for complex analysis queries.
